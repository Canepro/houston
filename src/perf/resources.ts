/**
 * Background resource sampler: poll `docker stats` for a repro's containers, so any
 * operation can be wrapped and its CPU/RAM cost reported.
 *
 * PORTABILITY. `docker stats` works on Docker Desktop and Linux. On Docker Desktop CPU% is
 * relative to the VM's allocated CPUs and memory is the VM's view (consistent with
 * node-exporter). The idle->peak DELTAS are the trustworthy signal; absolute numbers are
 * host-specific.
 *
 * A sampler on a thread would guard its series with a lock, because `stop()` waits with a
 * timeout and `report()`/`memSlopes()` are callable while the sampler runs. Here it is
 * cooperative asynchronous concurrency: one loop, a stop flag, and a `stop()` that awaits
 * the loop for at most `STOP_JOIN_MS`. A reader that runs between awaits sees a consistent
 * array, so the snapshot copy is kept for its other reason -- a caller may hold the result
 * while sampling continues -- rather than for mutual exclusion.
