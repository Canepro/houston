/**
 * Upgrade a running repro to another Rocket.Chat version — CLI and web API.
 *
 * An upgrade is where most "it broke after we upgraded" tickets actually live, because
 * Rocket.Chat runs its database migrations on boot. Reproducing that means taking a real
 * workspace with real data to a new version and watching what happens — which is only
 * meaningful if the data survives the trip.
 *
 * Requires the repro to be RUNNING. Not a stylistic choice: the pre-upgrade backup
 * needs Mongo up to dump, and the migrations only run when Rocket.Chat boots. A `down`ed
 * repro has no containers at all, so there is nothing to upgrade.
 *
 * The compose file is edited SURGICALLY (image tag + the oplog variable) rather than
 * regenerated from the spec. Regenerating would rebuild every launch-time decision from
 * defaults, so an --https repro would quietly lose its TLS and a bound repro its
 * --bind. Same approach `envvars` takes, for the same reason.
 *
 * A pre-upgrade backup is taken automatically and is what --rollback restores. The
 * backup is the point: it is what makes an upgrade something you can run twice.
