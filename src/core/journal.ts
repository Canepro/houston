/**
 * Durable notes about side effects that must be undone, so a killed process does not
 * leave them behind.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AND NOT A `finally`. The GUI runs long operations in the background, so
 * `systemctl restart`, an OOM kill or a plain SIGKILL ends them where they stand and skips
 * every `finally` they were relying on. Those blocks are doing real work: `backup` stops
 * Rocket.Chat for the duration of the dump, `loadtest` turns the API rate limiter OFF,
 * `capacity` arms the Mongo profiler and applies container CPU/RAM caps. Interrupted, all
 * of that outlives the process -- a workspace that silently is not serving, a rate limiter
 * left off -- with nothing anywhere recording that it happened.
 *
 * Cooperative cancellation cannot fix this. It helps a graceful shutdown; the dangerous
 * exit is the one where no code runs at all. What survives that is a note written BEFORE
 * the risky change and removed AFTER it is undone.
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT WRITING IT, IT IS KNOWING WHOSE IT IS. An open entry belongs either
 * to a job still running or to a process that died. Repairing the first would re-enable the
 * rate limiter underneath a load test that is still going. So each entry records the pid
 * AND that process's start time, and recovery touches an entry only when its owner is
 * provably gone -- pid alone is not enough, because the OS recycles them.
 *
 * ## This module is the SINK; `lib/journal.ts` is the registry
 *
 * `core/eks` writes the most expensive note in the product and sits BELOW this file, so the
 * registry is the dependency inversion. This installs itself at import, and replays any
 * subject predicate registered before it arrived -- which is why that queue exists.
 *
 * ## `record` and `clear` are SYNCHRONOUS, and that is a deliberate departure
 *
 * Atomic filesystem helpers expose asynchronous APIs, so that nothing blocks the event
 * loop. This module is the exception, and the reason is the thing it exists for.
 *
 * `core/eks` writes CLUSTER_UNFINISHED on the line BEFORE `eksctl create cluster` -- a
 * twenty-minute call that builds a VPC, a NAT gateway and a control plane. An awaited write
 * yields the event loop between "decided to write the note" and "the note is on disk", and
 * that gap is precisely the window the note exists to cover: a SIGKILL landing in it leaves
 * a billing cluster with no record anywhere that it was ever started. It has always been
 * synchronous here for that reason, and `lib/journal.ts`'s registry is declared
 * synchronous and id-returning because `eks` has to be able to clear the note it wrote.
 *
 * So the write is `writeFileSync` + `renameSync` -- the same temp-file-then-rename
 * `runner/paths.atomicWrite` does, spelled synchronously. It is one small file, not a
 * subprocess or a network call, which is the class of work the async rule is about.
