/**
 * INVARIANT: the declarative table IS the command surface.
 *
 * MECHANISM: RUNTIME REGISTRY.
 *
 * Earlier releases asked their command framework what it had registered and, for the
 * stray-registration case, searched the package for registrations that were not in the
 * registration order. Both are the same worry: a command can exist without the table
 * knowing, because a registration takes effect on import. Here the walk is of the built
 * Commander program -- the object `houston <anything>` is actually parsed by -- so a
 * command registered anywhere, by anything, is in it.
 *
 * The capabilities half is the one with a bug behind it: a document that can advertise a
 * command which does not answer in JSON has moved the caller's guess one level up and
 * made it authoritative. The version borrowed from elsewhere advertised
 * `houston.loadtest.v1` and `houston.capacity.v1` for two commands that printed a bare
 * payload. Derived from the registry on BOTH sides here, as it was there.
